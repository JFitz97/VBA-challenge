# VBA-challenge
In this challenge, stock data from 2018-2020 was analyzed. From a table of raw data, I made a summary table that listed each unique ticker (stock), the yearly price change on that ticker, the percent change over the year, and the stocks total volume. Additionally, I made a small summary table that displays the tickers with the greatest percent increase, the greatest percent decrease, and the greatest total volume for each worksheet. I have uploaded a screnshot of each worksheet that displays the results of this analysis. I've also uploaded the VBA scripts.
